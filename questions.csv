"Did VCs really cause the SBB bank run via Twitter? What impact have on trust in banks?","Did VCs really cause the SBB bank run via Twitter? What impact have on trust in banks?. And this I threw this part in because this is what we were talking about is causing a bank run a criminal offense? Or is there any culpability here? Okay, let's bring in some help right away on this. Yeah, I really demand to be heard on this topic. Wait, wait, wait, I do have stuff to say on this. Can we go back one topic though? I like that story that you told Ben. So the doctor was like, listen, as risky as this is, it's nothing compared to driving on the highway. I think that's a really, you know, Barry does all those slides in his presentation about like, you're more likely to be a bit and killed by a mosquito than a shark. And like all the risks that are clear and present right in front of our face are not necessarily the risks most likely to put us away. I think that's a really good, a really good analog. The biggest risk I ever took was going to a Mexican hospital during spring break. And I spray my wrist and the doctor was wrapping up my wrist and he had a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth. And then we went to the Mexican pharmacy for the pain pills. And that was probably the second biggest risk I ever took. Because I didn't even like know what the prescription was. I just started taking them and still being out on spring break drinking. And probably that was a bigger risk than driving on the highway in Grand Rapids, Michigan. So like that, you know, for me, like once I got through that, I don't worry so much about all the risks these days. She health care, she health care though for you. You're health care was much cheaper. I mean, I wouldn't have known the difference. I was probably 18. I don't even know who was paying for it or how it got paid for. I just, you know, it's one of those things. All right, I'm really excited to be on the show today. Did Twitter, people on Twitter cause the bank around? Kind of. Who could argue with that? Of course they did. Who else did it? Everyone named names, is there anyone particularly responsible? Anyone that felt that it was necessary to not only tell their portfolio companies behind the scenes to remove capital, but then to broadcast that in some sort of reverse virtue signal. Yeah, you did it. It was you. You were part of it. Do you think though that, so we've been talking about the blame game all week, do you think that there's anything that they can do to have safeguards in place, or is this just the sort of psychologically event that you can't plan for? Like they have circuit breakers in the stock market. Do you think that would ever make sense in a bank, or is that, does that kind of go against the whole idea of, well, I need my money. It's mine. Could anything like that ever slow this down? I don't think it, I don't think that apps in Twitter, there would not have been any issue, because there are short sellers who had been looking at the balance sheet and the income statement of this company for like six quarters now, and saying something's going on here. Like deposits were already quietly leaving. That's true. Pre the blow up on Twitter. That's so, that's one thing. And the second thing is they were severely off-sides in their bond portfolio. You can't have $90 billion in treasuries and no interest rate hedges, especially if you have that homogenous of a depositor base, like everyone in the depositor base lives in the same area and does the same thing for a living. Like you can't. So there were always issues. I'm not saying like Twitter is at fault for the bank having issues. Twitter definitely accelerated the meme of pull your money out of Silicon Valley bank. Now, the trust thing going forward I think is interesting, because I've been hearing this from a lot of people who never pay attention to the financial markets or the banking system. And I really can't tell if this is something people pay attention to for two weeks and then they move on to their lives and worry about the next thing, or if this is something that will actually seep into people's psyche and they will go, wait a minute, if I can have to think about this all the time, I'm going to be more thoughtful about where I have my money. It's such a great question. People learn and they, but they don't really learn. Or they learn, but they don't really change. In America, we have prioritized convenience over everything else, which is like you think about like internet passwords. People have the same password for every website, because it's not realistic that you're going to come up with 80 different passwords for 80 different apps. So it's just like this is the system that we have with banks. It's not going to be much different. Like as much as we all learned from Lehman, MF Global was three years later. Like it's just, you can't really eliminate all risk from financial institutions. You can't really have perfect trust in the financial system. It's not realistic to think that that's even possible. And so community banks will always be slightly riskier than money centers, but money center banks are risky too. And people will eventually default to whatever's the most convenient and easiest solution. So I don't think the idea of local banking is going to completely disappear. In fact, the events of this week might make it so that there's almost no advantage for any bank in terms of safety. Like we just might have seen the, we might have witnessed FDIC insurance becoming unlimited."
"My wife and I have the bulk of our investments in two accounts. Is this a dumb practice? Should we be more diversified with our institutions? We've been discussing this for a while and after SVB, it's brought the discussion back to the kitchen table. I understand that FDIC ensures up to 250,000, but once you get north of that, are there any best practices for what to do? And the second part of this was from another, another, another listener. If a brokerage fails, what happens to customers' holdings? ","My wife and I have the bulk of our investments in two accounts. Is this a dumb practice? Should we be more diversified with our institutions? We've been discussing this for a while and after SVB, it's brought the discussion back to the kitchen table. I understand that FDIC ensures up to 250,000, but once you get north of that, are there any best practices for what to do? And the second part of this was from another, another, another listener. If a brokerage fails, what happens to customers' holdings? So before Ben jumps in, just real quick, brokerage and bank are two separate things. FDIC and SIPIC are not the same thing. So there's a very important distinction there. And then like what I would basically just say, very, very, very simply, again, based on the events of this week, I don't think FDIC insurance is really going to matter anymore. Because if they were willing to bail out the people who had bank accounts at signature and at Silicon Valley, how could they discriminate against the next bank that comes along their depositors? So I almost think like it's de facto now a mood point. If you have money in a bank and the bank screws up, you're probably okay. Last thing, it's not as though Silicon Valley's bank balances were going to be wiped out to zero. This is more like, do they have to take a five or a 10% haircut? Like that's what we're talking about. This is not a bank that had a black gaping black hole of losses. They had a treasury bond portfolio that have held some maturity would have been money good. So this was never about like, oh my god, my savings were wiped out by a bank. This was a bank of sand, bank, and freed. No. And so I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about that in the public. They think like, oh, the bank was in solvent, meaning the deposits were going to be wiped out to zero. None of that was ever on the table or was ever going to happen. So we've gotten questions like this on the broker-jangle before in the past. What if Vanguard or Charles Schwab or Fidelity or Robinhood go under? What happens to my securities? And people have actually asked us that in the past and we've got a lot of questions on it this week saying, you know, I'm scared here. And I think the people are conflating the two to your point about brokerages or just banks. It's not like a brokerage can take your money and then or take your securities and lend them out on your behalf and speculate. So that it's kind of the... Well, FTX did that. Well, FTX did that. That's what FTX literally did. If you're not in the bank of Bernie Madoff or Sam Bankman freed. That's right. These are third-party custodians. The SEC has consumer protection rules in place. And I guess the way to think about it is if you own a stock or a bond or a mutual fund or an ETF, wherever you hold it, as long as it's not the bank of Madoff, those holdings are yours. And if something ever happened to the underlying financial firm, you still own those holdings. It's not like they can take them from you in a creditor or something if the bank went under or the financial firm. So here's something interesting. I don't think this is as prevalent now. But back in the day, there was a difference between holding securities in your own name versus holding them in street name. And when you hold them in your own name, you are deliberately... So the brokerage firm typically defaults to your securities. So let's say Ben has an account of the brokerage firm. And in that account, he owns shares of Meta and Goldman Sachs and MGen. Those are his three stocks. The default is that the brokerage is holding those securities for Ben in street name, which means they basically have them sitting there in an account that short sellers could borrow those stock certificates to use them to sell it short, etc. Now, if you want to be very specific, you could say, put those in my name, not in street name. And you can literally instruct the brokerage firm as the custodian of your securities to move those into what they call the vault or move those into your own name or whatever. So like this is the kind of thing that's like a little bit confusing for people, but what Ben said is the main point. They don't have the right to turn your securities into their securities. They can't use your securities as part of some bigger trade or speculation they're doing. However, on the bank side, it is that way. They can literally take your cash and invest your cash into contracts, into bonds, into stocks. So that's a very different phenomenon. And that's why the seller often Schwab made absolutely no sense to me because, yeah, Schwab has a bank, but that is a securities business and people's securities portfolios were not at risk. And if all of a sudden people started showing up and their securities were gone for whatever, I mean, this is the kind of thing. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's not going to happen. So Cliff, Cliff beat me to this in the chat, but I was going to ask, can you still get a paper certificate for stocks? Would that be a safer? I just had a stack of them in my, in my part. You can, you have to ask for it. You have to request it. I think you also have to put a panic on in your house, though, to store them. Otherwise, I'll just keep it all my precious metals. You know what? You get a paper stock certificate for Instagram. Like, you want to look cool? They're pretty cool. You ever see like five years ago Kanye West bought Kim Kardashian, like an anniversary present? He bought her like, like she had like physical stock certificates for Google, Disney, Apple, all these stocks. And she posted that to the Graham. And that was kind of cool because I think I'd encourage young people to want to invest. Like, so I kind of feel like that's what you would do something like that. When I was, when I was doing the business, we would buy clients shares of Disney and then have the stock certificate sent to them. And they would like give it to their son or daughter and like frame it in like a nursery or something. Other than that, there's no real purpose. I think I mentioned the last week, Duncan. I gave a talk to a high school recently. And as a thank you, they sent me like a share, one share of Disney in a little certificate. So you actually, I can't remember the name of the company. You can do that. Yeah, I've seen that before. Atari had really cool ones too. I've seen those. You can buy them at sea. All right, I'll do another one. But they're not this important. They're not like bearer bonds. Right. So die hard. You can steal them from someone. Right. Like if Duncan has one share of Disney or Ben has one share of Disney, I can't take that and then go turn it in for the money. It's not. Okay. So that works. Yeah. So not really that useful. It's not like heat the movie heat, right? Where like you could steal a tranche of stock certificates and turn them into my movement to bring back paper stock certificates. Okay. And part of that question was from Handle Crispy Delicious. So I forgot to put it down. That was a Twitter question, I think. "
"The federal home loan bank of San Francisco has a lot of exposure to SVB and other similar banks based on public SEC filings. My money market fund has approximately 20% of its holdings and FH LBE securities as a February 28th should I be concerned? I understand FH LBE is a GSE. You all will have to explain that one. I don't know what that means. Just like Fannie and Freddie, who I'm sure you remember from the GFC, global financial crisis for people watching. The second largest bank failure in US history is enough of a low probability event for me. Just want your thoughts on if I should be concerned with other low probability events, like something non crypto breaking the book because of SVB.","The federal home loan bank of San Francisco has a lot of exposure to SVB and other similar banks based on public SEC filings.

The second largest bank failure in US history is enough of a low probability event for me. Just want your thoughts on if I should be concerned with other low probability events, like something non crypto breaking the book because of SVB. So you see as a government sponsored enterprise, something like that. Okay. I was going to say entity is an enterprise. Yeah, it's one of the other. Okay. The Wall Street Journal had a piece of it. His FH LBE is, so when he says securities of he owns bonds. Yes, I think he's saying that. So the Wall Street Journal had a piece on this and they said that FH LBE basically underwrote some of those bonds, I think. And they said that they gave him 13 billion in bonds, but they had to pledge 45 billion in collateral for that. So the Wall Street Journal piece, and that's the FH LBE of San Francisco did put out a statement on it and they basically said we're triply rated finding his institution. Don't worry about it. I think this is, it sounds like it's pretty insulated. This seems pretty far down the line in terms of worries that it never really got to the point. I think where they're, they've had to worry about they said. So I think reaching the money market, we got another question, a money market's coming up, but this seems to be like another one of those systemic issues that do you really think that the Fed would allow when of their regional banks to sort of be holding the left holding back? Of course not. There's, you know, there's a debate to be had whether or not there should be a such thing as a GSA. I think like in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, they were, they were trying to encourage the suburbanization of America. They were actively looking to move people out of apartment buildings and move them into the suburbs and buy homes and buy automobiles and have kids and have public schools built. And in that environment where we were basically building something that didn't exist, you really needed Fannie, Freddie, now they back the entire mortgage market. There's not even an alternative to Fannie and Freddie. So I think these things are less risky if that makes sense to you rather than more risky in a crisis especially. This is the type of paper that people are clamoring for to own in what feels like a private market crisis. Yeah, the government is not going to let their own agencies go under. No. By the way, fun fact. Do you know why the government was so intent in the 1950s on moving people out into the suburbs from the cities? McDonald's? I don't know. No, communism. This is true. There was this red scare and the politicians were terrified that we were going to get these communist uprisings like they had all over Europe. Europe basically didn't have suburbs. They had farms in cities. So the idea was if people own property, they're less likely to become communists. There's a true story. No one's driving to a protest. You know what I mean? Literally. Literally. No, if you rent in an apartment building, you're more likely to be persuaded but not modern to be persuaded by these socialist uprisings versus if you own land. You like own a car, own a dishwasher. You're not running off to join a communist mob. I'm putting the pieces together here about why everyone says that millennials and gents are your communists because the last time they live in the city. The last no, the last time they built a bunch of homes was the 1950s. So maybe the millennials are trying to get the government to build more affordable housing. If you want to keep the status, if right, if the boomers want to keep the status quo for the next 20 years until they're all gone, the smartest thing to do is help turn the millennials into homeowners as quickly as possible. Otherwise, full-grown AOC style collective farms. We're going to rule. Yeah, don't forget I said this isn't live, right? We could edit this. Yeah, whatever. All right. "
"I'm considering keeping our emergency fund in a money market fund. Is this too risky without it having FDIC insurance? I hope you guys can help me understand this because I still don't understand the point of a money market fund. Really? What purpose is serves?","I'm considering keeping our emergency fund in a money market fund. Is this too risky without it having FDIC insurance? I hope you guys can help me understand this because I still don't understand the point of a money market fund. Really? What purpose is serves? So this is another one there. I feel like a lot of these questions come down to we have the rules and regulations in place that are written down on the books. And then we have like the unspoken ones that you have to kind of use common sense for. And we can't make any guarantees or promises. But with stuff like this, if you think about the prime fund broke the buck in 2008 because Lehman failed. And that caused like a run on money markets. They have done, they have put new rules and regulations in place. They actually did that there's some sort of they try to keep the NAV but some of them can float now. But also they allow some of these monies to put gates on them. I think 2016 they put some new regulations in place that would allow these funds to be gated if there was a run. So they did change the rules on these a little bit. We should talk about why the money market fund, the prime fund, which was one of the most prominent, you know, most widely used money market funds broke the buck. And there was like a good reason. They were jammed with commercial paper. And commercial paper is like seven day debt. The way to think about it is like the grease that allows commerce to take place. It's like how money moves around very quickly between corporations. These repo things and yeah. Yeah, it's not right. It's not like a long-term bond. It's like, look, for seven days I need you to float this much capital. And so there's a trading market for this kind of paper. And the commercial debt market froze up. One of the major warning signs that the Fed should have been paying more attention to in 06 and 07 and wasn't. Well, you better believe they pay a ton of attention to the overnight repo markets, the seven day funding markets, commercial paper. So again, this is like the, you know, it's less likely we'll be a victim of whatever the problem was from the last war. And all generals, you know, fight the last war. So I wouldn't worry tremendously about money market funds. But yeah, anything that you're doing to get a quote, better rate of return than somebody else or than what is standard, obviously is going to carry a little bit more risk. So you always want to say like, what is the risk worth taking? If it's for two extra basis points, probably not worth the risk. If it's for 20 extra basis points, I don't know how much money is at stake. There's a conversation to be had there. I looked this up in the investment company institute says there's $5 trillion in these funds. It's a lot of money. They broke them up into like government and institutional retail and like two trillion is in retail. I mean, there's a ton of options. You have online savings accounts. You can put your money in teabills. I mean, if you want the safest savings account, there is a teabill is pretty close. Maybe not as liquid as like an overnight savings account. You can put it on CDs or all these things you can put it in. The good news is I hate to like denigrate anyone who's worried about this stuff, but it almost feels like people who make $50,000 a year worried about billionaires getting taxed too much. Right? Because how many of us actually have 250k sitting in cash? Not many. I know what businesses do. That's the good thing you have to think about. Obviously, you don't want to keep all your money just sitting in a checking account. But there are so many different ways, easy ways that you can manage your cash these days. The good news is outside of the actual rules and regulations, it's pretty easy for people to keep their cash safe. If that's really a huge worry. I say one other thing just as like a capper to this whole conversation. I totally understand why people are worried about this stuff. Because it's a nightmare scenario, you trade years of your time, maybe decades of your time. Try to save money. It's so hard to do with the cost of everything, especially you have kids, you have real estate, you have a house. It's so hard to save money, you manage to. And then there's like this nightmare that like some force beyond your control can take it all away. I want people to understand that that doesn't actually happen. Like the history of the modern history of the United States is not one in which people wake up one day and some asshole banker ruin their lives. We just don't have this as part of our system. So yeah, of course it's understandable why people should worry. But don't fixate on this to the point where like you need Zanex or you can't sleep at night. It's not actually going to happen to you. The weird thing is that faith and trust are so much a bigger part of this whole financial system. That if the regulators and the government ever allowed that faith to be truly broken by people having their assets. The whole system would cease to work. It would all cease up and it wouldn't work anymore. I think people should understand like imagine that happens to you and not your neighbor because you banked the two different banks. What the hell is that? How fair to them. Come on. That's not. Matt Levine made a really good point. Somebody was saying maybe Cliff was talking about like the more I'm not on Twitter. I don't even know. Somebody was saying that moral hazard like of bailing out the depositors at one bank or sending the wrong message that you know what banks are one of these things that are just supposed to work. It's not like an investment in a mutual fund. You're not supposed to have to weed the fine print in a federally chartered or state chartered bank. It's just supposed to work and by work I don't mean you get the highest rate. I mean your fucking money is there when you need your money. That's how it's supposed to work. So I don't think there's any moral hazard in making sure that that works. I don't see it in this case. There have been quite a few comments on our videos recently about Silicon Valley bank of people kind of indicating that this was a bailout for the rich. But this is going to somehow hurt the average person. Is there any any truth to that or is that just the first part is true? The first part is true. The second part is not. Okay. And that's because if anything that tax backed people probably have more protection now than they did before this happened. I think it. So this is why we have to we have to stop playing this class this classism this game. It doesn't in the end it doesn't work for. Yes it's true that most of the signatories for the bank accounts at Silicon Valley bank are on the wealthier end of the spectrum. Of course if you have millions of dollars in a bank for your corporation and you are the head of the corporation obviously you are a quote unquote the rich. However if that deposit is lost you're probably closing your corporation. You're probably retaining some money the people you're firing get nothing out of the deal. So we really have to stop playing this game. It really doesn't it doesn't work for anyone if we start blowing up bank accounts. We heard from a few people who said I did not get my paycheck on Friday. I was supposed to get paid and it was supposed to run through SBB. Right. And I had to worry all weekend about getting my paycheck and this isn't some executive at a bank. This is this is a regular person who just needed their money and it was sweating out all weekend getting their paycheck. Such something the chat says why would a deposit make interest if there's no risk. Is that a fair point what would you say to that? Well I mean how many checking accounts actually pay interest right. They barely do. And the so the things that you do get paid for and yeah T bills are taking a risk because that's interest rate risk or inflation risk. So yeah anything anything that you put your money into is taking a little risk. But putting your money in a checking account is you're not actually taking any risk there right. You're not you're not expecting to earn any reward at least right."
"This banking crisis has to make it more likely that we see a recession right.", "This banking crisis has to make it more likely that we see a recession right. My initial read on this whole thing with that. We would say to get will say one more you guys flash that too fast for me. I don't process at that speed. The banking crisis has to make it more like yes more likely definitely Ben you ready. I think yeah no I think that anytime you if credit is going to contract in any way or if people just they're lack of trust in risk taking goes down that's deflationary to me. And I think that has to. Yeah it's just it's higher much higher likelihood than it was 10 days ago I think. Yeah it doesn't mean it it seals our fate but it's a disinflationary shock. It 100% changes people's sentiment probably changes some people's behavior. It's like a wake up call for people that haven't worried about this ever in their life all of a sudden like it you know it's makes it more likely I don't statistically I don't think either of us really have a strong view. This is 5% more likely 50 I don't know. 38 to 40. Why more? If people think the recession is more likely the stock market the stock market price in a recession last year. I don't know if anybody remembers 2022. I know for a lot of people. The last three years is the perfect example of why the stock market is not the economy. It's completely backwards some ways sometimes it goes with it sometimes it goes against it. The stock market is trot. There's a stock market thinks it's like eight steps ahead of the economy sometimes it is sometimes it isn't I don't think you can use the stock market as a barometer of are we going into recession route because to Josh's point what if we already priced it in and it's just waiting for it to happen if if we see a recession this stock market is going to take off who I mean that's the kind of thing where you can't use this stock market. Listen I wish there were a way I could just invest directly into GDP then all these experts on the economy would have like a vehicle they can like maybe Cal she does that I don't know. Can I just can I just buy a share of GDP and stop worrying whether or not the stock market is pricing it or not. Like together a pitch deck that sounds like a company. Yeah we'll get Silicon Valley back to back us. Oh God. But I mean this is also a great reminder that 14 days ago we were worried that the economy was too strong inflation was too hot. And then this thing just the mile top cocktail gets thrown in through the window in all the sudden we're worried about disinflation and a financial crisis and potential deflation. And those competing ideas I think this is one of those things where I don't know which one is going to win out here this guy on this guy on one of my shows last week was like this is the fed getting what it wants. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah they did not. No they did not want. I don't think so sir. Yes they don't want trust in the financial system to all of a sudden go that's not how they want inflation to come down. Right they were they were hoping higher interest rates would make some CEOs fire a few people they were not hoping that like they be dealing with bank failures and and being brought up on a congress to explain why they didn't see this coming. Right. Exactly I don't think so.
"What have you been doing? Did you do anything this weekend?","What you've been up to lately. But anyway, in Chicago, Josh and I, the next day, we had a lovely day, went for a walk. We went to the Field Museum, which was incredible. We tried to go to the Art Institute, but it was closed. By the way, I love Chicago. I love, love, love Chicago. It's an awesome city. It's New York, but 1,100th of the population density. I was kind of bummed out the next day walking on Park Avenue, so many people. But anyway, Josh and I went to Gibson's for lunch after that. And we got an incredible burger, one of the best burgers I've ever had. Guess how much it costs? This is a top shelf steakhouse. Am I going high or low here? I don't know. 30 dollars. 17 dollars. In New York, that's a 35 dollar burger."
"Do you have any movie and TV recommendations","Movie and TV recommendations. All right. I'll start with recommendations. I threw on – This is just added on HBO. One of my favorite comedies of all time. I Love You Man. I love that movie. Andy Samberg and – Is it J.K. Simmons? Is that his name? Yeah, the dad. The Hank Mark Dukas stuff. It's just – Paul Rudd is great in that movie. You know when that movie came out? A while ago, right? March 20th, 2009. Jeez. Yeah, we don't get good comedies anymore. That's for sure. I'm so sad. We don't get them anymore. They just don't happen. Yeah, I know. And Paul Rudd is doing Marvel movies now. I said to Robin on Friday, I'm going to the movies tonight. Logan goes, what are you saying? Logan's a three-year-old. And I said, either Creed III or Scream 6. I just – Saying that out loud. What is happening? Creed III or Scream 6? So it's either the sixth movie in a franchise that started 35 years ago or the third film in a reboot from 45 years ago, 50 years ago. That almost sounds like a bad joke. You basically said I'm going to see Rocky 9. Yeah, seriously. But anyhow, guess what? Scream 6, it was fun. I had a good time. Thoroughly entertained. No complaints. And guess what? Theater's packed. We're back. Wasn't it like the biggest one of all those Scream movies as well? In terms of box office? Yeah. Did I see that or was I wrong? Oh, really? I don't know. I blame inflation. Did you watch The Last of Us finale? Yeah. I was a little underwhelmed. I'm not going to lie. Me too. I was waiting for like a big something to happen and it was good, but I thought the show admittedly trailed off a little for as much as I loved it at the beginning. I thought it was just good at the end. Yeah. I was looking for great. I wanted something to happen that didn't happen, but it was a very good show. No complaints. It's good, but it was like I was waiting to be blown away by an ending and it didn't happen. What do we have coming back? Succession is coming back. What else? There's one other show that we watched. Yellow Jackets I like. I don't watch that. Yeah, there's a lot of TV coming. Robin watches it. I've mentioned this a few times. I'm a student of financial history. Panic of 1907 is a great book. You know who has the forward in that one? Oh, I do. Is it Galbraith? For the paperback. William Bernstein. Oh, did Galbraith write the book? No, it's Robert Brunner and Sean Carr, but it's a great book and it's definitely worth your time. I think reading on financial crises is, to understand the markets is really helpful. Am I right? Is that a shortish book or am I thinking of the 1932 one? The Galbraith one is short. It's only like 200 pages. It's not bad. Other one, I read on my flight to and from Chicago. I finished the book on the flight. I did some skimming because I pass over like, this is going to sound pretentious, but books that have like wisdom about them, like here's the takeaway. Here's what you need to do. I usually skip that stuff because I feel like it's kind of similar in most books. What do you mean? I would rather get to the meat of it in the data, in the stories, and then skip over like, here's what you should do about this. Because I feel like a lot of it has kind of been there, done that. Anyway, seen it before. What is The Good Life? The Good Life is the story of the longest scientific study of happiness. For Harvard, they started following these people in 1938, I think. And it was like 700 people. A lot of these people had just got back from war, and they followed them through their whole life. And they did a study on what makes people happy. They followed these people. They had quarterly interviews or yearly interviews, and they had surveys, and they did medical tests. It was like an extensive study on these people. They followed them from like their teenage years to when they died. And these people checked in all the time. And the stories on the people for this study were amazing. It was like, this is a lawyer who made a ton of money. And then this is a teacher who didn't make much money. And the teacher was way happier because he had better relationships. And the lawyer had no friends. And the whole point of the book was, I'm a huge fan of these happiness things. I can't get enough of it. Just because I think it's really interesting. But the whole point of the book was, the biggest thing to make you happier is having good relationships in your life. That was the one takeaway. But the stories of these people from World War II and the stuff they went through, and them having kids, and getting married, and getting divorced, and all this stuff. It's a really interesting case study in what makes people tick and what makes people happy. Very good book. Highly recommend. I also like happiness. Case I already missed it. We had a great episode on Monday. Oh, yes, we did. We talked to Dr. David Kelly from JPMorgan on Friday, right after Silicon Valley Bank went under. That guy was very impressive. Great. Yeah, check out our talkie book from Monday. He was very good. He had a lot of really good stats, too. His one stat that really stood out to me was, he said, we've had 23 months in a row where wage growth has been lower than inflation. Meaning, this is not like a wage price spiral from the 1970s. This is something else. He was also saying at the time, the Fed kind of messed up, which confirmation bias or not, I agreed with him. Next week, more dominoes to fall or are things back to normal? If you had to make a probability bet. You know what? I'm just going to punt. I'm just going to punt. 51 to 49, things are back to normal. It's aggressive. Okay. All right.
